## [3783. Mirror Distance of an Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/mirror-distance-of-an-integer)

Easy

You are given an integer n.

Define its mirror distance as: `abs(n - reverse(n))
where `reverse(n)` is the integer formed by reversing the digits of n.

Return an integer denoting the mirror distance of `n`.

abs(x) denotes the absolute value of x.

Example 1:

Input: n = 25

Output: 27

Explanation:

reverse(25) = 52.
Thus, the answer is abs(25 - 52) = 27.
Example 2:

Input: n = 10

Output: 9

Explanation:

reverse(10) = 01 which is 1.
Thus, the answer is abs(10 - 1) = 9.
Example 3:

Input: n = 7

Output: 0

Explanation:

reverse(7) = 7.
Thus, the answer is abs(7 - 7) = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 109
