## 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number
Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

### Example 1:

> Input: digits = "23"<br/>
> Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

### Example 2:

> Input: digits = ""<br/>
> Output: []

### Example 3:

> Input: digits = "2"<br/>
> Output: ["a","b","c"]
 
### Constraints:

- 0 <= digits.length <= 4
- digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].
