## 2427. Number of Common Factors

Given two positive integers a and b, return the number of common factors of a and b.

An integer x is a common factor of a and b if x divides both a and b.

### Example 1:

> Input: a = 12, b = 6</br>
> Output: 4</br>
> Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.

### Example 2:

> Input: a = 25, b = 30</br>
> Output: 2</br>
> Explanation: The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.

### Constraints:

- 1 <= a, b <= 1000
