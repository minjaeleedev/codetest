## 2549. Count Distinct Numbers on Board

You are given a positive integer n, that is initially placed on a board. Every day, for `10^9` days, you perform the following procedure:

- For each number x present on the board, find all numbers 1 <= i <= n such that x % i == 1.
- Then, place those numbers on the board.

Return the number of distinct integers present on the board after `10^9` days have elapsed.

### Note:

- Once a number is placed on the board, it will remain on it until the end.
- % stands for the modulo operation. For example, 14 % 3 is 2.
 

### Example 1:

> Input: n = 5<br/>
> Output: 4<br/>
> Explanation: Initially, 5 is present on the board. <br/>
> The next day, 2 and 4 will be added since 5 % 2 == 1 and 5 % 4 == 1. 
> After that day, 3 will be added to the board because 4 % 3 == 1. 
> At the end of a billion days, the distinct numbers on the board will be 2, 3, 4, and 5. 

### Example 2:

> Input: n = 3<br/>
> Output: 2<br/>
> Explanation: <br/>
> Since 3 % 2 == 1, 2 will be added to the board. <br/>
> After a billion days, the only two distinct numbers on the board are 2 and 3. 
 

### Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 100
