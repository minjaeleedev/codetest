## 643. Maximum Average Subarray I
You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer k.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.

### Example 1:

> Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4<br/>
> Output: 12.75000<br/>
> Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75

### Example 2:

> Input: nums = [5], k = 1<br/>
> Output: 5.00000
 

### Constraints:

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= k <= n <= 105
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
