## 1805. Number of Different Integers in a String
You are given a string word that consists of digits and lowercase English letters.

You will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example, "a123bc34d8ef34" will become " 123  34 8  34". Notice that you are left with some integers that are separated by at least one space: "123", "34", "8", and "34".

Return the number of different integers after performing the replacement operations on word.

Two integers are considered different if their decimal representations without any leading zeros are different.

### Example 1:

> Input: word = "a123bc34d8ef34"<br/>
> Output: 3<br/>
> Explanation: The three different integers are "123", "34", and "8". Notice that "34" is only counted once.

### Example 2:

> Input: word = "leet1234code234"<br/>
> Output: 2

### Example 3:

> Input: word = "a1b01c001"<br/>
> Output: 1<br/>
> Explanation: The three integers "1", "01", and "001" all represent the same integer because<br/>
> the leading zeros are ignored when comparing their decimal values.
 
### Constraints:
