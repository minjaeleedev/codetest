## 3190. Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three
You are given an integer array nums. In one operation, you can add or subtract 1 from any element of nums.

Return the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums divisible by 3.

### Example 1:

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> All array elements can be made divisible by 3 using 3 operations:
> 
> Subtract 1 from 1.
> Add 1 to 2.
> Subtract 1 from 4.

### Example 2:

> Input: nums = [3,6,9]
> 
> Output: 0

### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 50
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 50
