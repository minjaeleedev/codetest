## [396. Rotate Function](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-function)

Medium

You are given an integer array nums of length n.

Assume arrk to be an array obtained by rotating nums by k positions clock-wise. 
We define the rotation function F on nums as follow:

F(k) = 0 * arrk[0] + 1 * arrk[1] + ... + (n - 1) * arrk[n - 1].
Return the maximum value of F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1).

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,3,2,6]
Output: 26
Explanation:
F(0) = (0 * 4) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (3 * 6) = 0 + 3 + 4 + 18 = 25
F(1) = (0 * 6) + (1 * 4) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 2) = 0 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
F(2) = (0 * 2) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 3) = 0 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 23
F(3) = (0 * 3) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 4) = 0 + 2 + 12 + 12 = 26
So the maximum value of F(0), F(1), F(2), F(3) is F(3) = 26.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [100]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
