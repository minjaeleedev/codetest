## 2180. Count Integers With Even Digit Sum
Given a positive integer num, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to num whose digit sums are even.

The digit sum of a positive integer is the sum of all its digits.

### Example 1:

> Input: num = 4<br/>
> Output: 2<br/>
> Explanation:<br/>
> The only integers less than or equal to 4 whose digit sums are even are 2 and 4.    

### Example 2:

> Input: num = 30<br/>
> Output: 14<br/>
> Explanation:<br/>
> The 14 integers less than or equal to 30 whose digit sums are even are<br/>
> 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28.
 

### Constraints:
