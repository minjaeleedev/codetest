## Approach 1: Greedy + Forward Thinking

#### Intuition

We divide the numbers in the array into three groups a, b, and c, containing elements whose remainders modulo 3 are 0, 1, and 2, respectively. 
It is straightforward to take all numbers from group a, while the counts chosen from groups b and c depend on the situation.

Suppose we choose $cnt_b$ elements from b and $cnt_c$ elements from c. 
The remainder of their combined sum modulo $3$ is

$$ (cnt_b+2×cnt_c) \bmod 3= (cnt_b − cnt_c) \bmod 3 $$

We want this value to be $0$, so $cnt_b$ and $cnt_c$ must be congruent modulo $3$. 
Observe that $cnt_b$ must be at least $|b∣−2$, where $∣b∣$ denotes the size of group b. 
If $cnt_b <= ∣b∣−3$, we could add three more elements from $b$ and preserve the modulo constraint. 
The same argument implies $cnt_c >= ∣c∣−2$.

Therefore the possible values of cnt_b are $\{∣b∣−2,∣b∣−1,∣b∣\}$, and similarly for $cnt_c$. 
We need only check at most 3×3=9 combinations. 
When selecting elements from b or c we take the largest ones first, so b and c should be sorted in descending order.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSumDivThree(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        a = [x for x in nums if x % 3 == 0]
        b = sorted([x for x in nums if x % 3 == 1], reverse=True)
        c = sorted([x for x in nums if x % 3 == 2], reverse=True)

        ans = 0
        lb, lc = len(b), len(c)
        for cntb in [lb - 2, lb - 1, lb]:
            if cntb >= 0:
                for cntc in [lc - 2, lc - 1, lc]:
                    if cntc >= 0 and (cntb - cntc) % 3 == 0:
                        ans = max(ans, sum(b[:cntb]) + sum(c[:cntc]))

        return ans + sum(a)
```

#### Complexity Analysis
Let `n` be the length of `nums`.

- Time complexity: O(nlogn).

  Sorting groups b and c requires O(nlogn). The nine combinations form a constant factor and each case uses linear-time summation.

- Space complexity: O(n).

This is the space required for a, b, and c.

## Approach 2: Greedy + Backward Thinking

#### Intuition
In the first method we reason forward by deciding how many elements to select from b and c. 
Here we instead think in reverse by deciding how many elements to discard from those groups.

Let $tot$ be the sum of all elements in nums. There are three cases:

- If $tot \bmod 3=0$, nothing needs to be removed.

- If $tot \bmod 3=1$, we can either remove the smallest element in b or the two smallest elements in c.

- If $tot \bmod 3=2$, we can either remove the two smallest elements in b or the smallest element in c.

We sort b and c and remove the required smallest elements depending on the value of tot.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSumDivThree(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        a = [x for x in nums if x % 3 == 0]
        b = sorted([x for x in nums if x % 3 == 1], reverse=True)
        c = sorted([x for x in nums if x % 3 == 2], reverse=True)
        tot, remove = sum(nums), float("inf")

        if tot % 3 == 0:
            remove = 0
        elif tot % 3 == 1:
            if len(b) >= 1:
                remove = min(remove, b[-1])
            if len(c) >= 2:
                remove = min(remove, c[-2] + c[-1])
        else:
            if len(b) >= 2:
                remove = min(remove, b[-2] + b[-1])
            if len(c) >= 1:
                remove = min(remove, c[-1])

        return tot - remove
```

#### Complexity Analysis

Let n be the length of nums.

- Time complexity: O(nlogn).

  Sorting b and c dominates the runtime. 
  This can be improved to O(n) by tracking the smallest required values without sorting.

- Space complexity: O(n).

  This is the space required for a,b,c. 
  If not sorted, you can avoid calculating a,b,c by directly traversing the array nums once to find the two smallest numbers that give a remainder of 1 and 2 when divided by 3, thus optimizing the space complexity to O(1).


#### Approach 3: Dynamic Programming

#### Intuition
The previous methods rely on greedy selection or discarding. 
Here we apply dynamic programming to avoid sorting or greedy rules.

Let $f(i,j)$ be the maximum sum achievable using the first $i$ elements such that the sum modulo 3 equals $j$. 
For the current number nums[i], if we pick it we transition from $f(i−1,(j−nums[i]) \bmod 3)$, and if we skip it we transition from $f(i−1,j)$.
The relation is

$$f(i,j)=max\{f(i−1,j),f(i−1,(j−nums[i])\bmod 3)+nums[i]\}$$

The initial state is $f(0,0)=0$ and $f(0,1)=f(0,2)=-\infty$. This reflects that selecting nothing yields a sum of zero with remainder zero, while the other two remainders are invalid.

Since some languages may produce negative values in $(j−nums[i]) \bmod 3$, it is convenient to write the transitions as

$$
\begin{cases}
f(i−1,j) \to f(i,j) \\ 
f(i−1,j)+nums[i] \to f(i,(j+nums[i]) \bmod 3)
\end{cases}
$$

Each row depends only on the previous row, so we store only two rows and reduce space usage.

#### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSumDivThree(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        f = [0, -float("inf"), -float("inf")]
        for num in nums:
            g = f[:]
            for i in range(3):
                g[(i + num % 3) % 3] = max(g[(i + num % 3) % 3], f[i] + num)
            f = g

        return f[0]
```

#### Complexity Analysis
Let n be the length of nums.

- Time complexity: O(n).

- Space complexity: O(1).
