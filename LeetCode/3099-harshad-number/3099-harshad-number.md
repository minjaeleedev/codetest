## 3099. Harshad Number

An integer divisible by the sum of its digits is said to be a Harshad number.
You are given an integer x.
Return the sum of the digits of x if x is a Harshad number, otherwise, return -1.

### Example 1:

> Input: x = 18<br/>
> Output: 9<br/>
> Explanation:<br/>
> The sum of digits of x is 9. 18 is divisible by 9. So 18 is a Harshad number and the answer is 9.

### Example 2:

> Input: x = 23<br/>
> Output: -1<br/>
> Explanation:<br/>
> The sum of digits of x is 5. 23 is not divisible by 5. So 23 is not a Harshad number and the answer is -1.

### Constraints:

- 1 <= x <= 100
