## 961. N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array
You are given an integer array nums with the following properties:

nums.length == 2 * n.
nums contains n + 1 unique elements.
Exactly one element of nums is repeated n times.
Return the element that is repeated n times.

### Example 1:

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,3]<br/>
> Output: 3

### Example 2:

> Input: nums = [2,1,2,5,3,2]<br/>
> Output: 2

### Example 3:

> Input: nums = [5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4]<br/>
> Output: 5
 
### Constraints:

- 2 <= n <= 5000
- nums.length == 2 * n
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 104
- nums contains n + 1 unique elements and one of them is repeated exactly n times.
