## [678. Valid Parenthesis String](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parenthesis-string)

Medium

Given a string s containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*', return true if s is valid.

The following rules define a valid string:

Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
'*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string "".
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "(*)"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: s = "(*))"
Output: true
Example 4:

Input: s = "("
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s[i] is '(', ')' or '*'.
