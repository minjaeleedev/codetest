## 2652. Sum Multiples

Given a positive integer n, find the sum of all integers in the range [1, n] inclusive that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7.

Return an integer denoting the sum of all numbers in the given range satisfying the constraint.

### Example 1:

> Input: n = 7</br>
> Output: 21</br>
> Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 7] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7. The sum of these numbers is 21.

### Example 2:

> Input: n = 10</br>
> Output: 40</br>
> Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10. The sum of these numbers is 40.

### Example 3:

> Input: n = 9</br>
> Output: 30</br>
> Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 9] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9. The sum of these numbers is 30.

### Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 103
