## 530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

### Example 1:

![](./image1.jpg)

> Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]<br/>
> Output: 1

### Example 2:

![](./image2.jpg)

> Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]<br/>
> Output: 1

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 104].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 105
