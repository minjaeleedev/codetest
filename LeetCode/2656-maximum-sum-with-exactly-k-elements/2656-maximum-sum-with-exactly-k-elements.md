## 2656. Maximum Sum With Exactly K Elements

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. Your task is to perform the following operation exactly k times in order to maximize your score:

1. Select an element m from nums.
2. Remove the selected element m from the array.
3. Add a new element with a value of m + 1 to the array.
4. Increase your score by m.

Return the maximum score you can achieve after performing the operation exactly k times.

### Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3</br>
Output: 18</br>
Explanation: We need to choose exactly 3 elements from nums to maximize the sum.</br>
For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [1,2,3,4,6]</br>
For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 and nums = [1,2,3,4,7]</br>
For the third iteration, we choose 7. Then sum is 5 + 6 + 7 = 18 and nums = [1,2,3,4,8]</br>
So, we will return 18.</br>
It can be proven, that 18 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.</br>

### Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,5,5], k = 2</br>
Output: 11</br>
Explanation: We need to choose exactly 2 elements from nums to maximize the sum.</br>
For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [5,5,6]</br>
For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 = 11 and nums = [5,5,7]</br>
So, we will return 11.</br>
It can be proven, that 11 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.

### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
- 1 <= k <= 100
